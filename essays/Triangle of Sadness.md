## Triangle of Sadness:

This film started off a bit slow but I gradually became more absorbed into the film and story as it went on. I ended up enjoying this film more than I thought I would and I was left with some theories that I had developed after the film concluded. If you watch the film let me know if you agree with these theories:

## Theory 1 - Jarmo was based on Notch from Minecraft

I was thinking this throughout the film but when I googled this theory afterwards nothing popped up so I am assuming I am one of the rare people who thought this. The reasoning behind this is that both are rich Swedish programmers. Over dinner with the captain Jarmo also mentions gaming and selling code to gaming companies. They also look very similar. It could be a coincidence but I believe it isn't too farfetched for Jarmo to be based off of Notch.

## Theory 2 - "Triangle of Sadness" is referring to the love triangle involving Carl, Yaya, & Abigail

I know "triangle of sadness" was mentioned at the beginning of the film. However I was thinking it could be referring to the love triangle that formed between those three characters. I was thinking this because this love triangle eventually caused sadness and conflict between the characters. Abigail may have chosen to harm Yaya towards the end of the film based off the love triange, while the film ends with Carl running frantically through the jungle most likely in search of Yaya and Abigail. Overall it kind of makes sense to me. 

## Theory 3 - The pirate that washed ashore on the island was in fact a pirate (or not)

He claimed to have worked in the engine room and I read on Reddit that someone could confirm this because he could be briefly spotted lining up to go on the water slide during that scene. However I went back and rewatched this scene to see if I could find him. I found a similar looking man but the man looked to have a heavier figure to me and I don't think it was him. So therefore we cannot confirm if he was a pirate or not using that method that was mentioned in the Reddit thread.
