## Triangle of Sadness:

## Theory 1 - "Triangle of Sadness" is referring to the love triangle involving Carl, Yaya, & Abigail

I know "triangle of sadness" was mentioned at the beginning of the film. However I was thinking it could be referring to the love triangle that formed between those three characters. I was thinking this because this love triangle eventually caused sadness and conflict between the characters. Abigail may have chosen to harm Yaya towards the end of the film based off the love triange, while the film ends with Carl running frantically through the jungle most likely in search of Yaya and Abigail. Overall it kind of makes sense to me. 

## Theory 2 - Jarmo was based on Notch from Minecraft

I was thinking this throughout the film but when I googled this theory afterwards nothing popped up so I am assuming I am one of the rare people who thought this. The reasoning behind this is that both are rich Swedish programmers. Over dinner with the captain Jarmo also mentions gaming and selling code to gaming companies. He also kills a donkey which is a passive mob in Minecraft. Also, interestingly, the donkey mob is the only passive mob that can regenerate health, which is similar to the donkey in the movie where it doesn't die immediately, but recovers some health and requires Jarmo to cause more damage to it to finally kill it. Notch and Jarmo also look very similar. It could be a coincidence but I believe it isn't too farfetched for Jarmo to be based off of Notch.a

## Theory 3 - The pirate that washed ashore on the island was in fact a pirate (or not)

He claimed to have worked in the engine room and I read on Reddit that someone could confirm this because he could be briefly spotted lining up to go on the water slide during the scene where the workers are forced to go swimming. However I went back and rewatched this scene to see if I could find him. I found a similar looking man but the man looked to have a heavier figure to me and I don't think it was him. So therefore we cannot confirm if he was a pirate or not using that method that was mentioned in the Reddit thread.
