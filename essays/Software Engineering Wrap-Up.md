## INTRODUCTION:
I want to start off by saying that ICS 314 Software Engineering I was one of my favorite ICS courses to date. I say this because all aspects
of the course were useful to me. The course covers a lot of bases: from new languages, Github, Portfolios, to a practical project, it all
was worth my while. The material given in this course is absolutely necessary to a Computer Science student. I am overall thankful for the 
experience of taking this course. The following sections will address three aspects of the course that I thought were particularly useful.

## Open Source Software Development

Open source development was a topic that I am now comfortable with. Prior to this course I had very little experience with Github, now I cannot imagine working 
without it. Github provides an easy way to store code (in the form of repositories) for observation and later use. Github is also an incredible
tool for group work. Github has many features that allow for easy work within a group. I also gained familiarity with cloning, pushing/pulling, 
merging, and project boards. 

A sort of "breakthrough moment" I had with Github was tied to a previous experience I had with the site. A few years ago I was directed to Github
to download the code for an online game I had been playing. I went to Github because I was told that it would be possible to customize the game
to my own desires, and eventually be able to play my own version of the game. However I found the instructions to be complicated and beyond
my level of understanding. Therefore, I never had the chance to modify and play the game to my liking. I also had a very elementary understanding
of code at the time (this game had a lot of JavaScript).

After taking ICS 314, I now have the knowledge needed to actually work with open source software projects. I now have the tools (such as Github
Desktop and IDEs) to clone code and make edits easily. I also now know to test my code locally before deploying it to a real server. Concluding,
Github is the best version control system today for code, and for good reason.

## Development Environments

Development Environments go hand-in-hand with Github. I have had experience and success using IDEs such as Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ for
class assignments. I found working with Visual Studio on my Professional Portfolio to be the best option, because it worked seamlessly in transition
from Github Desktop to my actual development environment. On the other hand I prefered working with IntelliJ for web projects because of the instant
web browswer launch feature. 

The tricky thing about Development Environments are that they take a lot of practice. The more a person uses them, the more familiarity they gain with the subtle quirks of the software. This has the obvious benefit of increasing the speed in which a programmer is able to code and create projects. Oftentimes, projects have many moving parts, and one small error can set a programmer back and be incredibly frustrating. For example, I had trouble with the in-class WODs in the beginning of the semester, mostly due to my inexperience with the software. My trouble solving the WODs stemmed from technical difficulties, not really conceptual ones. This is why it is important to gain practice with the IDE before diving headfirst into massive projects.

## Agile Project Management

The two previous sections lead directly to this final one. Project management was something I had to learn on the job during ICS 314. Towards the end of the semester, we students were tasked with creating a project in a team setting. The coding and ideas itself weren't the most challenging part of the project. Rather, project management arguably was. It was somewhat difficult to coordinate a team effectively. All members have different abilites and opinions and to get everyone to agree on aspects of the site was no easy task. 

A tool to try and organize this was the Project Board on Github. We used the Project Board to create, document, and assign Issues to various members of the group. The Project Board was useful in managing this because of its clear visiblity. It was a little tricky at first because I did not understand the difference between Cards and Issues. Now I know that Issues are better because of the ability to "close" it on Github. Overall I am thankful for this tool and it definitely made our project development run more smoothly.

Overall thank you for this course!
