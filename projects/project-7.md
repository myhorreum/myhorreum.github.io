## INTRODUCTION:

I saw an opportunity for a job opening for the position of Systems Support Assistant at Telecommunications and Social Informatics Program (TASI) / Pacific Health Informatics Data Center (PHIDC) and I applied. I went through two interviews and ended up being chosen for the position. I am grateful to be working here simply for the fact that I learn so much. The classroom can only go so far, hands-on experience is invaluable. My position as Systems Support Assistant gave me experience with Linux, networking, scripting, disk partitioning, and virtual servers in sandboxed environments, among other things. If I did not work here, I would not have as much opportunity to sharpen my skills in these areas. It also gave me experience with IT tasks such as configuring Web Hosting Control Panels and the WSUS database. I look forward to working on more interesting projects with this organization. Here is some of what I did specifically:

## Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) :

* Detached SUSDB.mdf database file from C drive and attached it to E drive using SQL Server Management Studio.
* Used Powershell scripts to reduce bloated WSUS update count from 127,000 to 33,000 to 1600 (<2% of initial volume) and increased speed of WSUS software signficantly. Also eliminated random timeouts completely due to the mass of unneeded updates now being removed.
* Automated reporting through PowerShell scripts in Task Manager. Tabulated the updates based on attributes using HTML within PowerShell, then set the report to be auto-emailed to my supervisor on a weekly basis.

I also chose to keep a day-to-day [journal]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/nothere.txt) to document my experience.
