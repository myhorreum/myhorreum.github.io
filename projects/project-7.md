## INTRODUCTION:

I saw an oppurtunity for a job opening for the position of Systems Support Assistant and I applied. I went through two interviews and ended up being chosen for the position. I am greatful to be working here simply for the fact that I learn so much. The classroom can only go so far, hands-on experience is invaluable. My position as Systems Support Assistant gave me experience with Linux, networking, scripting, disk partitioning, and virtual servers in sandboxed environments, among other things. If I did not work here, I would not have as much opportunity to sharpen my skills in these areas. It also gave me experience with IT tasks such as configuring Web Hosting Control Panels and the WSUS database. I look forward to more working on more interesting projects with this organization.

I chose to keep a day-to-day [journal]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/nothere.txt) to document my experience.
