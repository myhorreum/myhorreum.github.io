## INTRODUCTION:
I chose to keep a day-to-day [journal]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/tasi.txt) to document my experience.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
The main coding framework behind this is known as the *finite state machine*. A finite state machine is a very simple, yet very effective coding techinque that is applicable in Computer Science as well as Engineering. Here, I designated the various "states" of my slot machine as the different logical steps one would take in interacting with the machine in real life. For example: starting the machine, spinning the rolls, obtaining coins, etc. Between the start and end states, nothing is static, and can be interchanged indefinitely until a user runs out of coins to play.

## CONCLUDING:
This fun project taught me the power of certain coding techniques. The idea that there is a lot more to a project underneath the graphics code-wise was also enforced. It also gave me more experience with working through the different stages of development of a project: going from a simple idea to an actual working device/software/etc. I look forward to programming something similar in the future!
