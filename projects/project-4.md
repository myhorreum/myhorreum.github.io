## INTRODUCTION:
This is a program that allows for interactive information storage, retrieval, and modification. I programmed this in the C language over the span of several months while being enrolled in the C Programming course in university. This was a challenging project, since I had only known Java at the time and C is considered to be more difficult to use than Java. The most frustrating part of the project was definitely working with pointers. Pointers are key to this database because the database is built upon the linked-list data structure. In C, we use pointers to link each record in the database to the next one. I definitely had a lot of segmentation faults while trying to get it to work. However once I started to notice the pattern of how the pointers were working in the list, it became much easier and I actually enjoyed programming this project. This project also got me a lot more comfortable with working with the Terminal. I now know all the basic commands of the Terminal, such as the ones used in comparing contents of files, making directories, compiling code etc. I also worked with the UH Unix server (we had to prove all of our code was compiled on the school server), and got comfortable moving files between servers using a File Transfer Protocol (FTP). I also managed my project using git as my preferred Version Control System. Lastly, after creating this project in C, I later recreated a C++ version of it as well.

## FEATURES?
Once executed, the program asks whether or not users have a pre-made records file to load into the database. After replying to this prompt, the program displays a straightforward user-interface. The interface offers several numbered options. Users can add a new record, delete record, print a record by name (also all records corresponding to a particular string of characters), print all records in database, modify a record's information by account number, and lasty quit the database. Upon quitting the program, all records are written out to a specified .txt file before the database's memory is cleaned of all records. Also, this program has a "debug mode" feature that is invoked with command line arguments. The debug feature allows the programmer to inspect their code by printing passed function arguments to the Terminal. Overall this project was about 1100 lines of code long.

In short, this project implements the following functions :

## CONCLUDING:
I grew a lot as a programmer over the course of this project. C requires you to be perfect. If your code is 99.99% correct, it is 100% wrong. I feel like C is a language that makes or breaks programmers. If someone is strong in C, they are likely strong in all other languages because C gives a programmer a lot of precision and control. Like they say, with great power, comes great responsibility.
