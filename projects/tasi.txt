03/10/20 (day 1) :

I came in 15 minutes early and met with Thomas, my supervisor and one of the people who interviewed me for the position. I was taken to the
office I would be doing my work in and introduced to the laptop (Dell) which I would be doing all work on. I was guided through the process of
setting up my uhtasi email specific and viber messaging accounts.

I was also introduced to my primary task which was to move many TASI web domains under the control of a web hosting panel. Thomas told me that 
the project should be done within a month. I was tasked with performing research on potential panels. I looked through paid panels such as cPanel
and Hosting Controller, as well as open source options such as Ajenti, VestaCP, and Webmin. I created a spreadsheet comparing and contrasting
various attributes the panels had with each other.

We ultimately chose to try out Webmin first. I also was interested in Hosting Controller, but had trouble finding info on how many domains were
allowed on its service as well as the cost of the service. I emailed them inquiring about it as well as planned to potentially test a demo of 
their service later on down the line (after working with Webmin).

The night before day 2 I did further research on Webmin and found that Virtualmin is actually the web hosting panel service of Webmin. I reported
this info to Thomas and we decided to work with Virtualmin. Interestingly, the Virtualmin download also includes Webmin functionality (you can
toggle between Webmin and Virtualmin). 

Before any downloads, Thomas introduced me to TASI's vCenter. vCenter Server is the centralized management utility for VMware, and is used to manage
virtual machines, multiple ESXi hosts, and all dependent components from a single centralized location. The VMWare is used to create template Virual
Boxes for use. TASI uses Virtual Boxes to test software they have interest in before deciding to use it. In this case we created a Linux CentOS template. 
The template generates an IP address that can be accessed from other computers. I used this IP address to work in the box from my workspace laptop. 

Back on my laptop, I went to VMWare (had to disable the block on Flash in Chrome, also what will happen to VMWare once Chrome abandones Flash??) in
order to work with the Virtual Box environment. Note to log into VMWare I used a uhtasi account to gain access. I connected to the VMware remote
console which essentially connected my monitor to the server. My immediate goal was to get the networking going.

Since I was working on CentOS, I used the terminal command nmtui to set the IP address of our Virtual Box to 10.100.10.236 and the netmask as 255.255.255.0.
Before doing this I changed the hostname and the root password to one of my choice using hostnamectl set-hostname your-new-hostname and sudo passwd root.
To test if the box had internet I pinged 8.8.8.8 (Google).
