03/10/20 (day 1) :

I came in 15 minutes early and met with Thomas, my supervisor and one of the people who interviewed me for the position. I was taken to the
office I would be doing my work in and introduced to the laptop (Dell) which I would be doing all work on. I was guided through the process of
setting up my uhtasi email specific and viber messaging accounts.

I was also introduced to my primary task which was to move many TASI web domains under the control of a web hosting panel. Thomas told me that 
the project should be done within a month. I was tasked with performing research on potential panels. I looked through paid panels such as cPanel
and Hosting Controller, as well as open source options such as Ajenti, VestaCP, and Webmin. I created a spreadsheet comparing and contrasting
various attributes the panels had with each other.

We ultimately chose to try out Webmin first. I also was interested in Hosting Controller, but had trouble finding info on how many domains were
allowed on its service as well as the cost of the service. I emailed them inquiring about it as well as planned to potentially test a demo of 
their service later on down the line (after working with Webmin).

03/11/20 (day 2) :

The night before day 2 I did further research on Webmin and found that Virtualmin is actually the web hosting panel service of Webmin. I reported
this info to Thomas and we decided to work with Virtualmin. Interestingly, the Virtualmin download also includes Webmin functionality (you can
toggle between Webmin and Virtualmin). 

Before any downloads, Thomas introduced me to TASI's VMWare.
