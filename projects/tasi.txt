03/10/20 (day 1) :

I came in 15 minutes early and met with Thomas, my supervisor and one of the people who interviewed me for the position. I was taken to the
office I would be doing my work in and introduced to the laptop (Dell) which I would be doing all work on. I was guided through the process of
setting up my uhtasi email specific and viber messaging accounts.

I was also introduced to my primary task which was to move many TASI web domains under the control of a web hosting panel. Thomas told me that 
the project should be done within a month. I was tasked with performing research on potential panels. I looked through paid panels such as cPanel
and Hosting Controller, as well as open source options such as Ajenti, VestaCP, and Webmin. I created a spreadsheet comparing and contrasting
various attributes the panels had with each other.

We ultimately chose to try out Webmin first. I also was interested in Hosting Controller, but had trouble finding info on how many domains were
allowed on its service as well as the cost of the service. I emailed them inquiring about it as well as planned to potentially test a demo of 
their service later on down the line (after working with Webmin).

03/11/20 (day 2) :

The night before day 2 I did further research on Webmin and found that Virtualmin is actually the web hosting panel service of Webmin. I reported
this info to Thomas and we decided to work with Virtualmin. Interestingly, the Virtualmin download also includes Webmin functionality (you can
toggle between Webmin and Virtualmin). 

Before any downloads, Thomas introduced me to TASI's vCenter. vCenter Server is the centralized management utility for VMware, and is used to manage
virtual machines, multiple ESXi hosts, and all dependent components from a single centralized location. The VMWare is used to create template Virual
Boxes for use. TASI uses Virtual Boxes to test software they have interest in before deciding to use it. In this case we created a Linux CentOS template. 
The template generates an IP address that can be accessed from other computers. I used this IP address to work in the box from my workspace laptop. 

Back on my laptop, I went to VMWare (had to disable the block on Flash in Chrome, also what will happen to VMWare once Chrome abandones Flash??) in
order to work with the Virtual Box environment. Note to log into VMWare I used a uhtasi account to gain access. I connected to the VMware remote
console which essentially connected my monitor to the server. My immediate goal was to get the networking going.

Since I was working on CentOS, I used the terminal command nmtui to set the IP address of our Virtual Box to 10.100.10.236 and the netmask as 255.255.255.0.
To test if the box had internet I pinged 8.8.8.8 (Google).

Once the network was set up I used the IP address of the box to log in through PuTTY. I then changed the hostname and the root password to one of my choice 
using hostnamectl set-hostname your-new-hostname and sudo passwd root.


03/12/20 (day 3) :

My primary task for the day was to install Virtualmin/Webmin and test it out. Through PuTTY I tried to use wget to get the download script, however
wget was not available in PuTTY. To solve this, I used sudo yum install wget. However to complicate things further, yum was not working. I was
getting Yum Command Fails with “Another app is currently holding the yum lock”. I used Google to help solve this. It told me to use the ‘ps -ef’ command
to check for the PID being occupied by yum (it will be shown next to grep). All I had to do to fix this was use kill -9 13023 to stop the hold-up.

wget was finally working (note I did not go with curl because it was not getting me the script effectively). I then used sh install.sh to run the 
install script. Another problem did arise during the installation process. I was getting the message that my hostname server was not fully qualified.
I did research on FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) and learned that I needed to update the /etc/hosts file. I had to put in the hostname and IP
of the server we had set up for Virtualmin use (the one we were currently logged in to PuTTY with). I updated the file with vi. I want to mention
that I exited vi without properly saving before editing how I wanted to; this auto-created a /etc/hosts.swp file. When using vi on the /etc/hosts
file, it gives the option of loading the /etc/hosts.swp file. To rid of this, simply use rm to delete the file. Also be sure your hostname matches
the hostname in the file that you do vi on, or else it will not work.

Virtualmin was finally installed and we got to test it with a web address generated from our IP address. After experimenting with Virtualmin and 
Webmin, my manager and I were not making too much progress. We were confused on exactly Virtualmin was trying to do. All we wanted was a place
to centrally manage existing web servers, while Virtualmin seemed to simplify new deployments of domains by auto creating a lot of stuff, 
overcomplicating a lot of what we were wanting to do. It seemed we might be getting more than we bargained for. However, at the end of the day,
before deciding to move on from Virtual/Webmin, we opted to do further research on them to see if it was still possible to do we wanted to do 
initially.
