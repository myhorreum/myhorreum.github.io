03/10/20 (day 1) :

I came in 15 minutes early and met with Thomas, my supervisor and one of the people who interviewed me for the position. I was taken to the
office I would be doing my work in and introduced to the laptop (Dell) which I would be doing all work on. I was guided through the process of
setting up my uhtasi email specific and viber messaging accounts.

I was also introduced to my primary task which was to move many TASI web domains under the control of a web hosting panel. Thomas told me that the
project should be done within a month. I was tasked with performing
research on potential panels. I looked through paid panels such as cPanel and Hosting Controller, as well as open source options such as Ajenti, 
VestaCP, and Webmin. I created a spreadsheet comparing and contrasting various attributes the panels had with each other.
