## INTRODUCTION:
The health of the environment has always been a large concern of mine. I like to try and do whatever I can to impact it positively. Through my friendship with Keiko Bonk, a local Green Party politician in Hawai'i, I was able to participate in the Biosphere Stewardship Scholarship project. This project involved community service and educational opportunities with other passionate students from around the globe. It is important to have projects like these to spread awareness and keep young people involved in these important topics. 

Aside from the scientific learning the actual experience was similar to [Survivor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series)), a show I enjoyed watching growing up. Every so often we would have a council at night. Friendships and rivalries were developed between different groups of stewards. Physical labor was similar to the challenges on the show. I often thought that this is what the show would likely feel like if I was actually on the show. 

Overall it was a great experience.
